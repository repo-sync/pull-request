# Releases are fully automated using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/).
#
# The following commit message conventions determine which version is released:
#
# 1. `fix: ...` or `fix(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps fix version, e.g. `1.2.3` → `1.2.4`
# 2. `feat: ...` or `feat(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps feature version, e.g. `1.2.3` → `1.3.0`
# 3. `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body: bumps breaking version, e.g. `1.2.3` → `2.0.0`
#
# Only one version number is bumped at a time, the highest version change trumps the others.
# Besides, publishing a new version to npm, semantic-release also creates a git tag and release
# on GitHub, generates changelogs from the commit messages and puts them into the release notes.
#
# If the pull request looks good but does not follow the commit conventions, update the pull request title and use the <kbd>Squash & merge</kbd> button, at which point you can set a custom commit message.
#
# With each new release, a breaking version tag (e.g. `v1`, `v2`, etc) is created or updated.
#
# ## Rollback Latest Release
#
# Let's say `v1.2.3` include a bug and we want to roll back to `v1.2.2`. To accomplish that, the `v1` tag needs to be updated. That can be done using the following code
#
# ```
# # update `v1` tag to point to `v1.2.2`
# git tag --force v1 v1.2.2
# git push --force --tags
# ```
#
